### Demographic estimates for care home patients aged 65 years and over receiving prescriptions

__Age and gender were consistent across the three financial years. Around two thirds of care home patients aged 65 years and over were female and 6 in 10 were aged 85 years and over.__

The number of care home patients increases with age, with the highest age band (90+) typically having the greatest number of care home patients. At some geographic levels lower age bands (such as 85-89) had higher patient counts than the highest (90+) age band.

There were more females than males at all geographic levels and age bands. Females aged 90+ was nearly always the largest group.

The age and gender profile of care home patients is broadly comparable to [ONS Estimates of care home patients from April 2020](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/12215carehomeandnoncarehomepopulationsusedinthedeathsinvolvingcovid19inthecaresectorarticleenglandandwales). The care home patient profile is shown in the chart below at an overall level and can be explored by NHS region, Local Authority and Integrated Care System (ICS) across three financial years. The non-care home patient profile is shown alongside for context.
