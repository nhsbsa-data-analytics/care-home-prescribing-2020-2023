Metric calculations are adapted for charts with many factors. For example, in the ‘BNF-level prescribing analysis by geography’ chart the Adur Local Authority in 2022/23 had a 'Mean prescription items PPM’ value of 0.25 for the Lansoprazole chemical substance. There were 1,199 Lansoprazole items prescribed in care homes in Adur in 2022/23, which is the numerator in this calculation. There were 4,828 care home patient-months in Adur in 2022/23, which is the denominator in this calculation. 1,199 / 4,828 = 0.25 to a single decimal place, as displayed in the chart.

The ‘BNF-level prescribing analysis by geography’ chart also has two metrics not using patient-months as a denominator. These are ‘% of total annual number of prescription items’ and ‘% of total annual drug cost’. These calculations also consider many factors. For example, the Allerdale Local Authority in 2022/23 had a ‘% of total annual number of prescription items’ value of 0.55% for the Salbutamol chemical substance. There were 431 Salbutamol items prescribed in care homes in Allerdale in 2022/23, which is the numerator in this calculation. There were 77,771 total items prescribed in care homes in Allerdale in 2022/23, which is the denominator in this calculation. 100 * (431 / 77,771) = 0.55% to a single decimal place, as displayed in the chart.
