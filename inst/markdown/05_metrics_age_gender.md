__The estimated average drug cost and prescribing volumes per patient-month are highest for care home patients aged 65 to 69 years.__

The drug cost for care home patients aged 65 to 69 years was around 3 times higher than non-care home patients of the same age, and the number of prescription items was around double. Younger care home patients also received more prescribing, at a higher drug cost than older care home patients. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) [report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/lifeexpectancyincarehomesenglandandwales/2021to2022) that care home residents aged 65 to 69 years also have the largest difference in life expectancy from non-care home residents, with a difference of 16.3 and 13.9 years between the female and male populations, respectively. They suggest that this difference may be because those entering care homes at younger ages are more likely to have conditions or diseases which limit their lives.

Prescribing metrics were closest amongst care home and non-care home patients aged 90+, where life expectancy differences were reported to be smallest by the ONS.

With the exception of prescribing of DAMN medicines, prescribing was higher among care home patients than non-care home patients across all age groups.

Male and female care home patients in a given age band had broadly similar prescribing metric values. The same was true for non-care home patients.
