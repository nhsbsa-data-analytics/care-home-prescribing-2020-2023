__There was some slight variation in the number of care home patients aged 65 years and over across deprivation deciles.__

Care home patient prescriptions were allocated an [Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) rank and associated decile based on the area ([Lower Layer Super Output Area](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/nhs_business_definitions/lower_layer_super_output_area.html#:~:text=Description,statistics%20in%20England%20and%20Wales)) in which the care home was located. There is some variation in patient numbers, with the most and least deprived deciles having lower numbers of patients. But it is likely that many residents changed LSOA when they moved into a care home, so this analysis provides information on the types of areas in which care homes are located rather than providing a measure of the deprivation levels of the areas from which residents came.
