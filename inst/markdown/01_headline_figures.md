## Introduction

In this article we provide unique insight into primary care prescribing patterns for care home and non-care home patients aged 65 years and over in England for the 2020/21, 2021/22 and 2022/23 financial years. According to the 2021 Census, [individuals aged 65 years and over formed most of the care home population](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/lifeexpectancyincarehomesenglandandwales/2021to2022#:~:text=individuals%20aged%2065%20years%20and%20over%20formed%20most%20of%20the%20care%20home%20population) (82.1%).

Patient address classification is based on experimental data linkage work. We welcome feedback, collaboration, and refinement of the methodology to see if it can be used in NHSBSA information systems in the future and how we can develop additional analyses.


## Key Findings

The estimated number of care home patients aged 65 years and over who received prescribing increased each financial year, from 2020/21 to 2022/23. The number of prescription items and drug cost also increased.

Around __5.9%__ of all items prescribed to patients aged 65 years and over were for care home patients in 2020/21 and this rose to __6.2%__ in 2022/23. An estimated __7.3%__ of the total primary care drug spend for patients aged 65 years and over was for care home patients in 2020/21 and this increased to __7.8%__ in 2022/23.

We estimated a monthly average __of 301,000 care home patients aged 65 years__ and over receiving prescriptions in 2022/23. They received an estimated 37 million prescription items at drug cost of £361 million during 2022/23.

As might be expected, __care home patients aged 65 years and over received more prescribing__ than non-care home patients receiving prescriptions, including prescribing of drugs associated with a falls risk. Care home patients also received a different range of medicines and are more likely to receive prescribing for pain relief. They received less prescribing for medicines associated with kidney injury compared with non-care home patients.

Almost two-thirds of care home patients aged 65 years and over who received prescriptions were female and 43% were females aged 85 years and over. There was some slight variation in care home patient counts by IMD decile, although it should be remembered that deprivation is based on care home location rather than providing a measure of the deprivation levels of the areas from which residents came. Monthly prescribing costs and volumes varied by age, gender, care home type and geography.


## Headline Figures

__The number of patients aged 65 years and over who received prescription items in care homes increased each year, as did the number of prescription items and drug cost.__

There was an estimated monthly average of 301,000 care home patients aged 65 years and over receiving at least one prescription item in 2022/23. They received around 37 million prescription items at a drug cost of £361 million.

This accounts for around __6.2%__ of all items prescribed to patients aged 65 years and over and around __7.8%__ of the drug cost. This represents increases from 2020/21, where there was an average of 289,000 patients, 35 million prescription items and a drug cost of £324 million.

The total number of care home patients who received at least one prescription item in 2022/23 was 481,000. The difference in the monthly average and annual estimates is explained by two key factors:

* The population is not stable – some patients become 65 years during the year, some move in or out of the care home and others may die;
* Not all care home patients receive a prescription in every month they are in a care home.

For this reason, when we calculate per patient estimates, we use the Per Patient Month (PPM).

The number of patients who received prescriptions in a care home peaked in April 2020, at 314,000 patients which was at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. April 2020 also had the highest number of care home prescription items, at 3.3 million items.
   
These numbers dropped during the pandemic then steadily rose again from March 2021. Post pandemic, November 2022 had the greatest number of patients, prescription items and drug cost, before seeing a slight decline from December 2022 onwards. There may be some seasonality, with a declining care home population during and around winter months. With only 3 years’ worth of data and the Covid-19 pandemic occurring in those 3 years, it is too early to determine if this is a real trend or not.
