__Many prescribing metrics had similar values for short and long-stay care home patients nationally, with greater variation in select geographies__

Care home patient prescribing has the liability to change as a patient's length of stay increases. While many patients may receive less prescribing (de-prescribing) as their length of stay increases, others may receive more prescribing. These changes are reflected in some of the prescribing metrics more than others.

The changes in the type and volume of prescribing as a care home patient length of stay increases, are more accentuated for more granular geographies. At a national-level, metric values were relatively stable, with the exception of % of patient months with 2+ ACAP medicines (which significantly decreased) and % of patient months with 3+ falls-risk medicines (which steadily increased).

See [Metrics](http://127.0.0.1/Metrics?prescribing-metrics) for more details on how prescribing metric values were generated in relation to care home patient length of stay.
