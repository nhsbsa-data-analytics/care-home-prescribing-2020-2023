__Many prescribing metrics had similar overall values for estimated length of care home stay, with greater variation in select geographies__

In this new section we explore whether prescribing metrics differ according to estimated care home length of stay in residential and nursing settings.

At an overall level there is little variation for most metrics in their respective settings for estimated length of stay. The exception is the percentage of patient months with 2 or more medicines with an anti-coagulant or anti-platelet action. This reduces as estimated length of stay increases across both nursing and residential settings.

There is greater variation in metric values when considered geographically, although this must be considered alongside an understanding of the local care home population. 

See [Metrics](http://127.0.0.1/Metrics?prescribing-metrics) for detailed information on how prescribing metric values were generated in relation to estimated care home patient length of stay.
