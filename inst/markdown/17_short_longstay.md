__Many prescribing metrics had similar values for short and long-stay care home patients nationally, with greater variation in select geographies__

Care home length of stay prescribing metric values have been introduced to the 2024/25 report iteration. Care home patient prescribing has the liability to change as a patient's length of stay increases. While many patients may receive less prescribing (de-prescribing) as their length of stay increases, others may receive more prescribing. These changes are reflected in some of the prescribing metrics more than others.

Care home length of stay metric values must be considered alongside an understanding of the local care home population. Where metric values differ greatly at a granular geographic level, there is usually a good reason why they do so. The potential variation of metric values may reflect local care requirements and may not reflect the quality of care these patients receive.

See [Metrics](http://127.0.0.1/Metrics?prescribing-metrics) for detailed information on how prescribing metric values were generated in relation to care home patient length of stay.
