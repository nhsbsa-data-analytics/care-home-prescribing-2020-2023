__Similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over live in residential homes and nursing homes.__
On average each month, we estimate similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over living in residential homes (£>latest_figures$ch_type_prop_residential<£%) and nursing homes (£>latest_figures$ch_type_prop_nursing<£%). This broadly corresponds to the [Census 2021](https://nhsbsauk.sharepoint.com/sites/InsightTeam-DataAnalyticsLearningLabDALL/Shared%20Documents/Data%20Analytics%20Learning%20Lab%20(DALL)/DALL/DALL%20Initiatives%20CRISP-DM/INT_646_Care%20homes%20Part%202/5.%20Output/Older%20people%20living%20in%20care%20homes%20in%202021%20and%20changes%20since%202011%20-%20Office%20for%20National%20Statistics) findings of an even split between each. A small percentage (£>latest_figures$ch_type_prop_both<£%) appear in both settings each month.
There were £>latest_figures$ch_type_prop_neither<£% which we were unable to link to the [CQC dataset](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/care-quality-commission-5/4d36bd23-127d-4acf-8903-ba292ea615d4/cqc-syndication-1/) in order to attribute to a residential or nursing home, due to incomplete address information.
