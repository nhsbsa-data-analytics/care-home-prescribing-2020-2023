__Similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over live in residential homes and nursing homes.__

On average each month, we estimate similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over living in residential homes (45.2%) and nursing homes (44.2%). A small percentage (2.0%) appear in both settings each month. There were 8.7% which we were unable to link to the [CQC dataset](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/care-quality-commission-5/4d36bd23-127d-4acf-8903-ba292ea615d4/cqc-syndication-1/) in order to attribute to a residential or nursing home, due to incomplete address information.
