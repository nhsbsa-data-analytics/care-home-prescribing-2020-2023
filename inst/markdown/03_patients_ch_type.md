__Similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over live in residential homes and nursing homes.__

On average each month, we estimate similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over living in residential homes (£>latest_figures$ch_type_prop_residential<£%) and nursing homes (£>latest_figures$ch_type_prop_nursing<£%). A small percentage (£>latest_figures$ch_type_prop_both<£%) appear in both settings each month. There were £>latest_figures$ch_type_prop_neither<£% which we were unable to link to the [CQC dataset](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/care-quality-commission-5/4d36bd23-127d-4acf-8903-ba292ea615d4/cqc-syndication-1/) in order to attribute to a residential or nursing home, due to incomplete address information.
