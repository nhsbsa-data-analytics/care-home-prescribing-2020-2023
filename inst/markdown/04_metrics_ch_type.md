### Estimated prescribing metrics for care home vs non-care home patients aged 65 years and over

In this section, we compare general prescribing volumes as well as established prescribing metrics including multiple medicines to a patient (polypharmacy), medicines associated with acute kidney injury (DAMN) and medicines associated with impaired cognition and falls (ACB). We also consider some new metrics associated with patient falls. See Metrics for more details.

__Care home patients aged 65 years and over had higher levels of prescribing than non-care home patients across most metrics. Care home patients in nursing homes had higher levels of prescribing than those in residential homes.__

The drug cost per patient-month (PPM) for care home patients aged 65 years and over was around double that of non-care home patients. The number of prescription items PPM was around one and half times that of non-care home patients.

Care home patients received a greater number of unique medicines PPM and the proportions of patients on 6+ and 10+ unique medicines were higher among care home patients compared to non-care home patients.

Prescribing of two or more DAMN medicines was the only metric where non-care home patients had higher values than care home patients. Prescribing of two or more ACB medicines was the only metric where values decreased year on year in all four settings.

Age can be restricted to 85 and over in the chart. This subgroup shows similar but less pronounced differences between care home and non-care home patients than the comparisons for all older people.
