### Estimated prescribing metrics for care home vs non-care home patients aged 65 years and over

In this section, we compare general prescribing volumes as well as established prescribing metrics including:

- multiple medicines to a patient (polypharmacy)
- medicines associated with acute kidney injury (DAMN)
- medicines associated with anti-cholinergic burden (ACB)
- medicines associated with an increased falls-risk

See [Metrics](http://127.0.0.1/Metrics?prescribing-metrics) for more details.

__Care home patients aged 65 years and over had higher levels of prescribing than non-care home patients across most metrics. Care home patients in nursing homes had higher levels of prescribing than those in residential homes.__

The drug cost per patient-month (PPM) for care home patients aged 65 years and over was around double that of non-care home patients. The number of prescription items PPM was around one and half times that of non-care home patients.

Care home patients received a greater number of unique medicines PPM. The proportions of patients on 6+ and 10+ unique medicines were higher among care home patients compared to non-care home patients.

Prescribing of two or more DAMN medicines was the only metric where non-care home patients had higher values than care home patients.  Prescribing of two or more ACB medicines decreased each year from 2020/21 to 2022/23.

Age can be restricted to 85 and over in the chart. This subgroup shows similar but less pronounced differences between care home and non-care home patients than the comparisons for all older people.
