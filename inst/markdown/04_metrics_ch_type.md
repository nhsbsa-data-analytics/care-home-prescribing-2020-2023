## Estimated prescribing metrics for care home vs non-care home patients aged 65 years and over

_Similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over live in residential homes and nursing homes.__

On average each month, we estimate similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over living in residential homes (41%) and nursing homes (45%). A small percentage (3%) appear in both settings each month. There are 11% who we were unable to link to the [CQC dataset](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/care-quality-commission-5/4d36bd23-127d-4acf-8903-ba292ea615d4/cqc-syndication-1/) in order to attribute to a residential or nursing home, due to incomplete address information. It should be noted that these proportions are not comparable to those reported by NHS Digital in the [Adult Social Care Activity and Finance Report, England 2020-21](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/adult-social-care-activity-and-finance-report/2020-21#resources), which considers clients accessing long term support by setting.

In this section, we compare general prescribing volumes as well as established prescribing metrics including <a onclick="internalLink('Metrics', 'patients-prescribed-6-or-10-unique-medicines');">multiple medicines</a> to a patient (polypharmacy), <a onclick="internalLink('Metrics', 'medicines-likely-to-cause-kidney-damage-damn');">medicines associated with acute kidney injury</a> (DAMN) and <a onclick="internalLink('Metrics', 'anticholinergic-burden-acb');">medicines associated with impaired cognition and falls</a> (ACB). We also consider some new <a onclick="internalLink('Metrics', 'medicines-associated-with-falls-risk-in-elderly-patients');">metrics associated with patient falls</a>.

__Care home patients aged 65 years and over had higher levels of prescribing than non-care home patients across most metrics. Care home patients in nursing homes had higher levels of prescribing than those in residential homes.__

The drug cost per patient-month (PPM) for care home patients aged 65 years and over was nearly double that of non-care homes patients. The number of prescription items PPM was around one and half times that of non-care home patients. 

Care home patients received a greater number of unique medicines PPM and the proportions of patients on 6+ and 10+ unique medicines were higher among care home patients compared to non-care home patients.

Prescribing of 2 or more DAMN medicines was the only metric where non-care home patients had higher values than care home patients . Prescribing of 2 or more ACB medicines was the only metric where values decreased year on year in all four settings.
