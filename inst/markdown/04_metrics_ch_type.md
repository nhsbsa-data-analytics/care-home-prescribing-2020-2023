__Care home patients aged 65 years and over had higher levels of prescribing than non-care home patients across most metrics. Care home patients in nursing homes had higher levels of prescribing than those in residential homes.__

In this section, we compare general prescribing volumes as well as established prescribing metrics including multiple medicines to a patient (polypharmacy), medicines associated with acute kidney injury (DAMN) and medicines associated with impaired cognition and falls (ACB). We also consider some new metrics associated with patient falls. See Definitions for more details.

The drug cost per patient-month for care home patients aged 65 years and over was nearly double that of non-care homes patients. The number of prescription items per patient-month was around one and half times that of non-care home patients. 

Care home patients received a greater number of unique medicines per patient-month and the proportions of patients on 6+ and 10+ unique medicines were higher among care home patients compared to non-care home patients. 
Prescribing of 2 or more DAMN medicines was the only metric where non-care home patients had higher values than care home patients overall and across both settings. Prescribing of 2 or more ACB medicines was the only metric where values decreased year on year in all settings.
