### Estimated prescribing metrics for care home vs non-care home patients aged 65 years and over

__Similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over live in residential homes and nursing homes.__

On average each month, we estimate similar proportions of care home patients aged 65 years or over living in residential homes (44.5%) and nursing homes (42.5%). A small percentage (2.1%) appear in both settings each month. There were 10.9% which we were unable to link to the [CQC dataset](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/care-quality-commission-5/4d36bd23-127d-4acf-8903-ba292ea615d4/cqc-syndication-1/) in order to attribute to a residential or nursing home, due to incomplete address information. There are numerous published sources of data on Adult Social Care home resident numbers that have differing coverage and scope. The data in this publication relate to residents receiving prescriptions and therefore will differ from other estimates. See the <a onclick="internalLink('Annex');">Annex</a> for further sources of data available on the care home population.

In this section, we compare general prescribing volumes as well as established prescribing metrics including multiple medicines to a patient (polypharmacy), medicines associated with acute kidney injury (DAMN) and medicines associated with impaired cognition and falls (ACB). We also consider some new metrics associated with patient falls. See <a onclick="internalLink('Metrics');">Metrics</a> for more details.

__Care home patients aged 65 years and over had higher levels of prescribing than non-care home patients across most metrics. Care home patients in nursing homes had higher levels of prescribing than those in residential homes.__

The drug cost per patient-month (PPM) for care home patients aged 65 years and over was nearly double that of non-care homes patients. The number of prescription items PPM was around one and half times that of non-care home patients. 

Care home patients received a greater number of unique medicines PPM and the proportions of patients on 6+ and 10+ unique medicines were higher among care home patients compared to non-care home patients.

Prescribing of 2 or more DAMN medicines was the only metric where non-care home patients had higher values than care home patients. Prescribing of 2 or more ACB medicines was the only metric where values decreased year on year in all four settings.

You can also restrict the ages to 85 and over in the charts. This subgroup shows similar but much less pronounced differences between care home and non-care home patients than the comparisons for all older people.
