### Overall prescribing for care home patients aged 65 and over

__The number of patients aged 65 years and over who received prescription items in care homes increased each year. The number of prescription items and drug cost increased also.__

There was an estimated monthly average of 323,000 care home patients aged 65 years and over receiving at least one prescription item in 2023/24. They received around 40 million prescription items at a drug cost of £396 million.

This accounts for around __6.3%__ of all items prescribed to patients aged 65 years and over and around __7.9%__ of the drug cost. This represents increases from 2020/21, where there was a monthly average of 289,000 patients, 35 million prescription items and a drug cost of £324 million.

The total number of care home patients who received at least one prescription item in 2023/24 was 496,000. The difference in the monthly average and annual estimates is explained by two key factors.

- The population is not stable – some patients turn 65 years old during the year, some move in or out of the care home and others may die.
- Not all care home patients receive a prescription in every month they are in a care home.

For this reason most [Metrics](http://127.0.0.1/Metrics?prescribing-metrics) were calculated on a [patient-month](http://127.0.0.1/Metrics?prescribing-per-patient-month-ppm) basis.

By month, patient counts dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic then steadily rose again from March 2021. The number of patients who received prescriptions in a care home peaked in January 2024, at 328,000 patients. January 2024 also had the highest number of care home prescription items, at 3.6 million items. 

There is some seasonality in the data, but the effect is small compared to the overall trend.
