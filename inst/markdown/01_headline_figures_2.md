### Overall prescribing for care home patients aged 65 and over

__The number of patients aged 65 years and over who received prescription items in care homes increased each year. The number of prescription items and drug cost increased also.__

There was an estimated monthly average of £>latest_figures$ch_monthly_pats<£ care home patients aged 65 years and over receiving at least one prescription item in £>latest_figures$latest_fy<£. They received around £>latest_figures$ch_annual_items_m<£ million prescription items at a drug cost of ££>latest_figures$ch_annual_cost_m<£ million.

This accounts for around __£>latest_figures$ch_annual_prop_items<£%__ of all items prescribed to patients aged 65 years and over and around __£>latest_figures$ch_annual_prop_cost<£%__ of the drug cost. This represents increases from 2020/21, where there was a monthly average of 289,000 patients, 35 million prescription items and a drug cost of £324 million.

The total number of care home patients who received at least one prescription item in £>latest_figures$latest_fy<£ was £>latest_figures$latest_estimate_fy_total_ch_pats<£. The difference in the monthly average and annual estimates is explained by two key factors.

- The population is not stable – some patients turn 65 years old during the year, some move in or out of the care home and others may die.
- Not all care home patients receive a prescription in every month they are in a care home.

For this reason most [Metrics](http://127.0.0.1/Metrics?prescribing-metrics) were calculated on a [patient-month](http://127.0.0.1/Metrics?prescribing-per-patient-month-ppm) basis.

By month, patient counts dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic then steadily rose again from March 2021. The number of patients who received prescriptions in a care home peaked in £>latest_figures$ch_peak_pats_time<£, at £>latest_figures$ch_peak_pats_count<£ patients. £>latest_figures$ch_peak_items_time<£ had the highest number of care home prescription items, at £>latest_figures$ch_peak_items_count<£ million items. 

There is some seasonality in the data, but the effect is small compared to the overall trend.
