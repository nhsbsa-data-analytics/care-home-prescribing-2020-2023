## Data Ethics Statement

At NHSBSA, we are committed to the ethical use of data to support better health outcomes.

This analysis uses NHS prescription data processed by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) under its statutory duties. The data is pseudonymised and aggregated, and no personally identifiable information is disclosed. The processing is conducted under the lawful basis of *public task* (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(e)) and *health and social care purposes* (Article 9(2)(h)) and does not require explicit patient consent.

The NHSBSA’s [Privacy Notice](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/our-policies/privacy/nhs-prescription-and-pharmacy-services-privacy-notice) outlines the scope and safeguards of this data use. The *National Data Opt-Out* does not apply to this processing, as it is exempt under current regulations.

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been completed for this analysis to assess and mitigate privacy risks associated with the use of personal data. The DPIA confirms that appropriate safeguards are in place, and the data use complies with GDPR and NHSBSA’s data governance standards. 

Our analysis uses an experimental approach to infer care home residency. These inferences are used for population-level analysis and do not affect individual care or decision-making.

This analysis is exploratory and while validation has been conducted, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in available data and the experimental nature of the classification approach.

We recognise the importance of transparency, equity, and responsibility. While the insights aim to inform policy and enhance medication safety, we remain mindful of the potential for unintended impacts. We welcome feedback and collaboration with practitioners, residents, and carers to ensure the analysis continues to support inclusive, ethical, and community-responsive healthcare improvement.
