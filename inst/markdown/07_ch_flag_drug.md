### Care home prescribing drug profile

__The profile of medicines prescribed to patients aged 65 years and over, differs between care home and non-care home__

The [British National Formulary](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/) (BNF) groups medicines together based on their primary therapeutic indication. The BNF has multiple levels. Here we consider prescribing at four levels starting with the largest grouping called chapters, followed by sections, paragraphs and chemical substances.

The chart below allows you to view and compare the 20 most common medicines at each drug level prescribed to care home patients and non-care home patients by drug cost and number of prescription items per patient-month and annually. 

Overall, care home patients aged 65 and over were more likely to receive drugs in the Central Nervous System Chapter than non-care home patients, whereas non-care home patients were more likely to receive drugs in the Cardiovascular chapter.  

In 2022/23, at a chemical substance level, Colecalciferol (Vitamin D) was the most prescribed drug to care home patients followed by Paracetamol. For non-care home patients it was Atorvastatin (typically used to lower cholesterol).By drug cost, it was Apixaban (which helps prevent blood clots) among both care home and non-care home patients.
