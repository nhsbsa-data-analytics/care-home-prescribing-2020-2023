__The profile of medicines prescribed to patients aged 65 years and over, differs significantly between care home and non-care home__

The British National Formulary (BNF) groups medicines together based on their primary therapeutic indication. The BNF has multiple levels. Here we consider prescribing to care home patients at 4 levels starting with the largest grouping called chapters, followed by sections, paragraphs and chemical substances.

The chart below allows you to view and compare the 20 most common medicines at each drug level prescribed to care home patients and non-care home patients by drug cost and number of prescription items per patient month and annually.

Overall, care home patients are more likely to receive drugs for pain relief than non-care home patients, whilst nutrition products account for a greater percentage of drug cost. The greatest percentage of items were from the Central Nervous System chapter in care homes and the Cardiovascular chapter in non-care homes.
