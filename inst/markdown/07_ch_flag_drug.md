### Care home prescribing drug profile

__The profile of medicines prescribed to patients aged 65 years and over differs between care home and non-care home.__

The [British National Formulary](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/) (BNF) groups medicines together based on their primary therapeutic indication. The BNF has multiple levels. Here we consider prescribing at four levels starting with the largest grouping called chapters, followed by sections, paragraphs and chemical substances.

The chart below shows the 20 most common medicines at each BNF level for care home patients. This can be viewed by drug cost and number of prescription items per patient-month and annually. Non-care home values are included for comparison.

Overall, care home patients aged 65 and over were more likely to receive drugs in the Central Nervous System Chapter than non-care home patients, whereas non-care home patients were more likely to receive drugs in the Cardiovascular chapter.
