__London has higher estimated drug costs and overall prescribing volumes per patient-month.__

The chart and map show prescribing metrics by NHS region, ICS, and Local Authority. This is based on the patient address, which may be a care home. Take note that some residents may have care commissioned by a Local Authority which differs to the Local Authority in which the care home is situated.

All prescribing metrics other than prescribing of two or more DAMN medicines are higher across all geographical breakdowns and years for care home patients, compared to non-care home patients.

The average drug cost and number of prescription items per patient-month was highest in the London NHS region for both care home and non-care home patients. The London NHS region was also highest among care home patients for polypharmacy unique medicines metrics and highest for DAMN medicines in non-care home patients.

There were large variations in care home prescribing by Local Authority and ICS. Further ICS and Local Authority trends, at both a care home and non-care home-level, can be discovered through exploration of the chart.
