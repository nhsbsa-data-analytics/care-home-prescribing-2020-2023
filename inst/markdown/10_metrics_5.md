In July 2023, this patient received prescribing in both a non-care home and care home setting (i.e. they moved into a care home this month). August 2023 is then the first month in which they only received care home prescribing. Their prescribing in this month would be included in calculations for ‘Month-1’ patients. Their prescribing in September 2023 would be included in calculations for ‘Month-2’ patients, and so on. In November 2023 the patient received prescribing in both a non-care home and care home setting. The length of stay monthly cumulative tally at this point ‘resets’ back to zero. In this instance, the patient goes on to have another month of only care home prescribing (February 2024) and the length of stay monthly cumulative tally begins again.

As can be seen, every month of only care home prescribing per patient contributes toward a length of stay metric calculation. With fewer patients staying in care homes for extended periods of time, fewer patients will contribute toward ‘Month-12’ and ‘Month-13’ values, and so on. For simplicity, the estimated care home length of stay value is then banded into one of five categories. These are: 1-3 Months, 4-6 Months, 7-9 Mons, 10-12 Months and 13+ Months. Final prescribing metric values are then calculated in relation to these five categories.
